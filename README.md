# Evaluating Musical Trends through custom defined popularity
## Summary
Through this project, we are investigating a temporal evolution of musical popularity through custom-defined popularity groups and inherent musical features within each of the group. We are analyzing to observe if there is a significant trend (either a rise or a  fall) of musical features from 1980s to 2020. From the interactive radar plot and classical machine learning, we conclude that **there is NO significant musical feature that governs the trend from 1980 to 2020.** It is interesting to see that our own definition of **musical popularity was correlated not to inherent musical features but artists name.** This shows that the musical trend was more or less inluenced by *Who* produced *What* instead of *What* was produced. 
## Motivation and Distinction
Many research groups including social sciences, computer science, and even musical industry leaders have tackled to analyze the musical trends in a variety of perspectives through means of social surveys and artificial intelligence. Only few have dived into temporal aspects of musical trends through musical feature-based popularity. In this project, a new approach is suggested by 
1. Providing a custom definition of a musical popularity based on duration of awareness (how long people have recognized it as popular)
2. Interactively visualizing musical features based on custom defined popularity groups
3. Building classical machine learning models to distinguish governing musical features
