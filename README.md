# Evaluating Musical Trends through custom defined popularity
## Summary
## Motivation and Distinction
Many research groups including social sciences, computer science, and even musical industry leaders have tackled to analyze the musical trends in a variety of perspectives through means of social surveys and artificial intelligence. Only few have dived into temporal aspects of musical trends through musical feature-based popularity. In this project, a new approach is suggested by 
1. Providing a custom definition of a musical popularity based on duration of awareness (how long people have recognized it as popular)
2. Interactively visualizing musical features based on custom defined popularity groups
3. Building classical machine learning models to distinguish governing musical features
